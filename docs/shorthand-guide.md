# dotnet-claude-kit Quick Reference

A compact reference for all components: slash commands, skills, agents, rules, hooks, and MCP tools.

## Slash Commands

Workflow skills at `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — each registers its `/name` automatically (Claude Code merged slash commands into skills).

| Command | Description | Related Skill / Agent |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| `/dotnet-init` | Project setup (existing or greenfield) — detects or scaffolds, then generates CLAUDE.md | project-setup / dotnet-architect |
| `/spec` | Relentless questioning until human + AI agree on a persisted spec | -- / -- |
| `/plan` | Enter plan mode with architecture awareness (consumes specs) | architecture-advisor / dotnet-architect |
| `/scaffold` | Architecture-aware feature scaffolding (templates inline) | -- / dotnet-architect |
| `/build-fix` | Bounded build-fix and test-fix loops | -- / build-error-resolver |
| `/verify` | 7-phase verification pipeline | -- / code-reviewer |
| `/tdd` | Guided test-driven development workflow | testing / test-engineer |
| `/code-review` | MCP-powered, blast-radius-prioritized code review | -- / code-reviewer |
| `/health-check` | Project health assessment with letter grades | -- / code-reviewer |
| `/security-scan` | Deep security audit (OWASP Top 10, secrets, packages) | -- / security-auditor |
| `/migrate` | EF Core schema, .NET version, and NuGet migrations | ef-core / ef-core-specialist |
| `/de-sloppify` | Systematic code cleanup pass | -- / refactor-cleaner |
| `/checkpoint` | Mid-session save: commit + brief handoff note | -- / -- |
| `/wrap-up` | Session handoff lifecycle (end-of-session + session start) | instinct-system / -- |
| `/outdated` | Dependency health: outdated packages, CVEs, license traps | -- / -- |
| `/arch-check` | Architecture conformance: dependency direction, layer violations | architecture-advisor / dotnet-architect |

Instinct operations (status, export, import) are modes of the `instinct-system` skill — say "show instincts", "export instincts", or "import instincts".

## Rules (10)

| Rule File | Scope | Key Enforcement |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| `coding-style.md` | All C# files | File-scoped namespaces, primary constructors, sealed, records, collection expressions |
| `architecture.md` | Solution structure | No repo over EF, feature folders, dependency direction, shared kernel contracts only |
| `security.md` | All code | No hardcoded secrets, parameterized queries, explicit auth, HTTPS, no PII in logs |
| `testing.md` | Test projects | Integration-first, Testcontainers, AAA, behavior over implementation, no InMemory DB |
| `performance.md` | All code | CancellationToken, TimeProvider, IHttpClientFactory, HybridCache, async all the way |
| `error-handling.md` | All code | Result pattern, ProblemDetails, no broad catch, IExceptionHandler, boundary validation |
| `git-workflow.md` | Git operations | Conventional commits, atomic commits, branch naming, never force-push main |
| `agents.md` | Agent interactions | MCP-first, subagent routing, skill loading, model selection |
| `hooks.md` | Hook responses | Auto-accept format, never skip pre-commit, review post-test analysis |
| `packages.md` | NuGet packages | Always latest stable, never hardcode from training data, `dotnet add` without --version |

All rules have `alwaysApply: true` -- they are enforced on every interaction.

## Hooks & Automation Scripts (7)

Only the first three are Claude Code hooks (auto-run via `hooks/hooks.json`); the rest are git pre-commit hooks and workflow utilities (see `hooks/README.md`):

| Script | Kind | Behavior |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| `pre-bash-guard.sh` | Claude Code hook — PreToolUse (Bash) | Guards against dangerous bash commands |
| `post-edit-format.sh` | Claude Code hook — PostToolUse (Edit/Write) | Runs `dotnet format` on modified files |
| `post-scaffold-restore.sh` | Claude Code hook — PostToolUse (Edit/Write) | Runs `dotnet restore` after .csproj changes |
| `pre-commit-format.sh` | Git pre-commit (manual install) | Verifies formatting before commit |
| `pre-commit-antipattern.sh` | Git pre-commit (manual install) | Scans for antipatterns before commit |
| `pre-build-validate.sh` | Utility script | Validates project structure before build |
| `post-test-analyze.sh` | Utility script (pipe test output) | Analyzes test results for insights |
