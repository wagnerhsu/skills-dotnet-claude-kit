## The Problem

Claude Code is powerful, but out of the box it doesn't know **your** .NET conventions. It generates `DateTime.Now` instead of `TimeProvider`. It wraps EF Core in repository abstractions. It picks an architecture without asking about your domain. It reads entire source files when a Roslyn query would cost 10x fewer tokens.

**dotnet-claude-kit fixes all of that.**

## What This Is

A curated knowledge and action layer that sits between Claude Code and your .NET project. Drop a single `CLAUDE.md` into your repo and Claude instantly knows:

- Which architecture fits your project (VSA, Clean Architecture, DDD, Modular Monolith)
- How to write modern C# 14 with primary constructors, collection expressions, and records
- How to build minimal APIs with `IEndpointGroup` auto-discovery, `TypedResults`, and proper OpenAPI metadata
- How to use EF Core without repository wrappers, with compiled queries and interceptors
- How to test with `WebApplicationFactory` + `Testcontainers` instead of in-memory fakes
- How to navigate your codebase via Roslyn semantic analysis instead of expensive file reads
- **How to scaffold complete features, run health checks, review PRs, and enforce conventions**

**No configuration. No setup wizards. Just copy one file and go.**

## What Makes This 10x

An **action layer** on top of the knowledge layer — Claude doesn't just know the right patterns, it actively applies and enforces them:

| Capability | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Surgical Code Analysis** | 20 Roslyn-powered MCP tools with guaranteed bounded responses. `get_symbol_source` reads ONE method body instead of the whole file. `get_file_outline` shows what's in a file before reading it. Every list-returning tool is capped with `TotalFound` — no tool can blow your context window. |
| **Architecture Enforcement** | `/arch-check` verifies the code still matches its declared architecture (VSA, Clean, DDD, Modular Monolith): dependency direction, layer violations, module leaks, cycles — with file:line evidence and fixes. |
| **Dependency Health** | `/outdated` reports stale packages, CVEs, and commercial-license traps (MediatR 13+, MassTransit 9+, FluentAssertions 8+, AutoMapper 15+) before an innocent update-all changes your legal position. |
| **Security Mapping** | `get_endpoint_map` inventories every route with its auth posture (`authorized`/`anonymous`/`unmarked`) in one token-cheap call — `/security-scan` starts every auth audit there. |
| **DI X-Ray** | `get_di_registrations` maps every service registration with lifetimes, duplicate detection, and captive-dependency risks (singleton holding scoped). |
| **Agents That Learn** | Specialist agents carry `memory: project` — the code reviewer, architect, and security auditor learn your conventions across sessions instead of rediscovering them. The reviewer is tool-enforced read-only; the cleanup agent works in an isolated worktree. |
| **Scaffolding** | One command → complete feature with Result pattern, validation, OpenAPI metadata, pagination, CancellationToken, and tests. 9-point checklist enforced. All 4 architectures. |
| **Health Check** | Automated codebase analysis using MCP tools: anti-pattern scan, diagnostics, dead code detection, test coverage → graded report card. |
| **PR Review** | Multi-dimensional code review: anti-patterns, diagnostics, API surface changes, blast radius, architecture compliance, test coverage. |
| **Convention Learning** | Detects project-specific patterns (naming, structure, modifiers) and enforces them in new code. Adapts to your codebase. |
| **Active Hooks** | Automated quality scripts — format on edit, destructive-command guard, restore on .csproj change — tested on Windows and Linux in CI. |
| **Always Current** | Every package recommendation verified against NuGet with licensing-trap warnings, and a .NET 11 preview watch so guidance never rots. |

## Why dotnet-claude-kit?

| Metric | Without Kit | With Kit | Impact |
|--------|-------------|----------|--------|
| **Architecture decisions** | Claude picks randomly | Asks questions, recommends with rationale | Correct architecture from day one |
| **Code quality** | Generic C#, legacy patterns | Modern C# 14 with idiomatic .NET 10 | Zero "fix this pattern" revision cycles |
| **Codebase navigation** | Reads entire files (500-2000+ tokens each) | Roslyn MCP queries (30-150 tokens each) | **~10x token savings** on exploration |
| **Anti-patterns generated** | `DateTime.Now`, repository-over-EF, `new HttpClient()` | `TimeProvider`, direct DbContext, `IHttpClientFactory` | Production-ready on first generation |
| **Testing approach** | In-memory fakes, mocked everything | `WebApplicationFactory` + `Testcontainers` | Tests that catch real bugs |
| **Production resilience** | No retry, no circuit breakers | Polly v8 pipelines with telemetry | Handles transient failures automatically |

**The result**: Less time reviewing and correcting Claude's output. More time shipping features.

## Installation

### Plugin Install (Recommended)

Install as a Claude Code plugin — all 47 skills (including 16 slash-command workflows), 10 agents, hooks, and MCP config activate globally. The 10 rules ship in this repo for you to copy into your project's `.claude/rules/`:

```bash
# In your terminal — install the Roslyn MCP server
dotnet tool install -g CWM.RoslynNavigator
```

> **macOS/Linux**: If the server fails with "No .NET SDKs were found", set `DOTNET_ROOT` to your .NET installation root (e.g. `/usr/local/share/dotnet`). See the [MCP server troubleshooting guide](mcp/CWM.RoslynNavigator/README.md#troubleshooting).

Then inside a Claude Code session:

```
# Add the marketplace and install the plugin
/plugin marketplace add codewithmukesh/dotnet-claude-kit
/plugin install dotnet-claude-kit
```

**For local development/testing** (loads directly from disk, no install needed):

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/dotnet-claude-kit
```

### Per-Project Setup

Navigate to your project directory (existing or empty) and run:

```bash
/dotnet-init
```

**Existing project?** It detects your solution, scans .csproj SDKs, reads your tech stack from config, asks architecture questions, and generates a customized `CLAUDE.md`.

**Greenfield project?** It asks what you're building, scaffolds the full solution structure (`dotnet new sln`, projects, `Directory.Build.props`, `src/` and `tests/` folders), then generates `CLAUDE.md`. Follow up with `/scaffold` to add your first feature.

No manual template copying needed.

<details>
<summary><strong>Manual Template Copy (Alternative)</strong></summary>

If you prefer manual setup, copy the template matching your project type:

```bash
cp templates/web-api/CLAUDE.md ./CLAUDE.md           # REST API
cp templates/modular-monolith/CLAUDE.md ./CLAUDE.md   # Multi-module system
cp templates/blazor-app/CLAUDE.md ./CLAUDE.md          # Blazor app
cp templates/worker-service/CLAUDE.md ./CLAUDE.md      # Background workers
cp templates/class-library/CLAUDE.md ./CLAUDE.md       # NuGet packages
```

Replace `[ProjectName]`, update tech stack, choose your architecture.

</details>

Start Claude Code — 47 skills, 10 agents, and 20 MCP tools activate automatically. Copy the 10 rules into your project's `.claude/rules/` to make them always-loaded.

That's it. Claude now writes .NET code the way a senior .NET engineer would.

<details>
<summary><strong>Manual Install (Alternative)</strong></summary>

If you prefer to clone the repo and wire things up manually:

```bash
# 1. Install the MCP server globally
dotnet tool install -g CWM.RoslynNavigator

# 2. Register it in Claude Code at user scope (available in ALL projects)
claude mcp add --scope user cwm-roslyn-navigator -- cwm-roslyn-navigator --solution ${workspaceFolder}

# 3. Clone the kit
git clone https://github.com/codewithmukesh/dotnet-claude-kit.git

# 4. Load as a local plugin (or copy a template manually)
claude --plugin-dir ./dotnet-claude-kit
```

</details>

## What You Get

### Before dotnet-claude-kit

```csharp
// Claude generates this
public class OrderService
{
    private readonly IOrderRepository _repo;  // unnecessary abstraction over EF Core

    public async Task<Order> CreateOrder(CreateOrderDto dto)
    {
        var order = new Order();
        order.CreatedAt = DateTime.Now;  // wrong — use TimeProvider
        order.Items = dto.Items.ToList();
        await _repo.AddAsync(order);
        return order;  // leaks domain entity to API
    }
}
```

### After dotnet-claude-kit

```csharp
// Claude generates this
public static class CreateOrder
{
    public record Command(string CustomerId, List<OrderItemDto> Items) : IRequest<Result<Response>>;
    public record Response(Guid Id, decimal Total, DateTimeOffset CreatedAt);

    internal sealed class Handler(AppDbContext db, TimeProvider clock)
        : IRequestHandler<Command, Result<Response>>
    {
        public async Task<Result<Response>> Handle(Command request, CancellationToken ct)
        {
            var order = Order.Create(request.CustomerId, request.Items, clock.GetUtcNow());
            db.Orders.Add(order);
            await db.SaveChangesAsync(ct);
            return Result.Success(new Response(order.Id, order.Total, order.CreatedAt));
        }
    }
}
```

```csharp
// Each endpoint group auto-discovered — Program.cs never changes
public sealed class OrderEndpoints : IEndpointGroup
{
    public void Map(IEndpointRouteBuilder app)
    {
        var group = app.MapGroup("/api/orders").WithTags("Orders");
        group.MapPost("/", CreateOrderHandler)
            .WithName("CreateOrder").Produces<CreateOrder.Response>(201)
            .ProducesValidationProblem()
            .AddEndpointFilter<ValidationFilter<CreateOrder.Command>>();
    }
}
```

**Result pattern. FluentValidation with endpoint filters. IEndpointGroup auto-discovery. TypedResults with OpenAPI metadata. CancellationToken everywhere. Sealed handlers. TimeProvider injection. DbContext directly.** Every pattern comes from the skills in this kit.

## Slash Commands (16)

Shortcut workflows that orchestrate skills and agents. Type the command and Claude handles the rest. These are workflow skills — each lives at `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, registers its `/name` automatically, and carries its methodology inline (no separate knowledge twin to load).

| Command | Purpose | Works With |
|---------|---------|------------|
| `/dotnet-init` | Project setup (existing or greenfield) — detects or scaffolds, then generates CLAUDE.md | project-setup skill, dotnet-architect agent |
| `/spec` | Relentless questioning until human + AI agree on a persisted spec (`docs/specs/`) | feeds /plan and /tdd |
| `/plan` | Architecture-aware planning — consumes approved specs | architecture-advisor skill, dotnet-architect agent |
| `/verify` | 7-phase verification: build → analyzers → antipatterns → tests → security → format → diff | — |
| `/tdd` | Red-green-refactor with xUnit + Testcontainers | testing skill, test-engineer agent |
| `/scaffold` | Architecture-aware feature scaffolding (all 4 architectures, per-architecture templates included) | dotnet-architect agent |
| `/code-review` | MCP-powered, blast-radius-prioritized code review | code-reviewer agent |
| `/build-fix` | Bounded build-fix and test-fix loops with progress detection | build-error-resolver agent |
| `/checkpoint` | Mid-session save: commit + brief handoff note | — |
| `/security-scan` | OWASP + secrets + vulnerable dependency audit | security-auditor agent |
| `/migrate` | EF Core schema, .NET version, and NuGet migrations with rollback | ef-core-specialist agent |
| `/health-check` | Project health assessment with letter grades (A-F) | code-reviewer agent |
| `/de-sloppify` | Systematic cleanup: format → dead code → analyzers → sealed | refactor-cleaner agent |
| `/wrap-up` | Session handoff lifecycle: end-of-session ritual + session-start loading | instinct-system skill |
| `/outdated` | Dependency health: outdated packages, CVEs, and commercial-license traps | get_nuget_packages MCP tool |
| `/arch-check` | Architecture conformance: dependency direction, layer violations, module leaks | get_project_graph MCP tool |

Instinct operations (status, export, import) are modes of the [instinct-system](skills/instinct-system/SKILL.md) skill — say "show instincts", "export instincts", or "import instincts".

## Rules (10)

Project-level conventions that apply to every interaction once loaded. Rules ship in this repo (and via the templates) — copy them into your project's `.claude/rules/` to make them always-loaded.

## Agents (10)

Specialist agents that Claude routes queries to automatically. Each agent loads the right skills, uses MCP tools for context, and knows its boundaries.

| Agent | When It Activates | What It Does |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| [dotnet-architect](agents/dotnet-architect.md) | "set up project", "architecture", "scaffold feature", "init project" | Runs the architecture questionnaire, scaffolds features, initializes projects |
| [api-designer](agents/api-designer.md) | "create endpoint", "OpenAPI", "versioning" | Designs minimal API endpoints with proper metadata, versioning, and auth |

| [refactor-cleaner](agents/refactor-cleaner.md) | "clean up", "dead code", "de-sloppify" | Systematic cleanup: dead code removal, formatting, sealing, CancellationToken |

## Templates (5)

Drop-in `CLAUDE.md` files that configure Claude for specific project types. Copy one file, replace the placeholders, done.

| Template | For | Includes |
|----------|-----|----------|
| [web-api](templates/web-api/) | REST APIs, microservices | Architecture options (VSA/CA/DDD), minimal APIs, EF Core, testing |
| [modular-monolith](templates/modular-monolith/) | Multi-module systems | Module boundaries, per-module DbContext, Wolverine/MassTransit integration events |
| [blazor-app](templates/blazor-app/) | Blazor Server / WASM / Auto | Component organization, render mode strategy, bUnit testing |
| [worker-service](templates/worker-service/) | Background processing | BackgroundService patterns, Wolverine/MassTransit consumers, proper cancellation |
| [class-library](templates/class-library/) | NuGet packages, shared libraries | Public API design, XML docs, semantic versioning, SourceLink |

## Roslyn MCP Server

Token-efficient codebase navigation via Roslyn semantic analysis. Instead of Claude reading entire source files (500-2000+ tokens each), it queries the MCP server for exactly what it needs (30-150 tokens).

| Tool | What It Does | Replaces |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `find_symbol` | Locate type/method definitions | Grep/Glob across all .cs files |
| `find_references` | Find all usages of a symbol | Grep for the type name |
| `find_implementations` | Find interface implementors | Searching for `: IInterface` |
| `find_callers` | Find all methods calling a method | Manual grep for method name |
| `find_overrides` | Find overrides of virtual/abstract methods | Searching for `override` keyword |
| `get_type_hierarchy` | Inheritance chain + interfaces | Reading multiple files |
| `get_project_graph` | Solution dependency tree | Parsing .csproj files manually |
| `get_public_api` | Public API without full file | Reading entire source files |
| `get_symbol_detail` | Full signature, params, XML docs | Reading entire source files |
| `get_diagnostics` | Compiler warnings/errors | Running `dotnet build` and parsing |
| `detect_antipatterns` | 10 .NET anti-pattern rules | Manual code review |
| `find_dead_code` | Unused types, methods, properties | Manual inspection of all files |
| `detect_circular_dependencies` | Project and type-level cycles | Manually tracing references |
| `get_dependency_graph` | Method call chain visualization | Reading multiple files and tracing |
| `get_test_coverage_map` | Heuristic test coverage mapping | Searching for test files manually |
| `get_symbol_source` | Exact source of ONE member (bounded, capped) | Reading the whole file for one method |
| `get_file_outline` | Type/member skeleton of a file, no bodies | Reading the file to see what's in it |
| `get_nuget_packages` | PackageReference inventory with CPM awareness | Parsing csproj/props files manually |
| `get_endpoint_map` | Route inventory with auth posture per endpoint | Grepping Map*/controllers by hand |
| `get_di_registrations` | DI map: lifetimes, duplicates, captive risks | Reading Program.cs and extensions |

The MCP server starts automatically via `.mcp.json`. No manual setup required.

See [mcp/CWM.RoslynNavigator/README.md](mcp/CWM.RoslynNavigator/README.md) for details.

## Knowledge Base

Living reference documents updated per .NET release:

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [dotnet-whats-new](knowledge/dotnet-whats-new.md) | .NET 10 / C# 14 features and how to use them |
| [common-antipatterns](knowledge/common-antipatterns.md) | Patterns Claude should never generate |

| [decisions/](knowledge/decisions/) | Architecture Decision Records explaining every default |

## Hooks & Automation Scripts (7)

Three Claude Code hooks run automatically (declared in `hooks/hooks.json`); the rest are git pre-commit hooks and workflow utilities — see [hooks/README.md](hooks/README.md) for setup:

| Script | Kind | What It Does |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `pre-bash-guard.sh` | Claude Code hook — PreToolUse (Bash) | Blocks destructive git ops (force push, reset --hard), warns on risky commands |
| `post-edit-format.sh` | Claude Code hook — PostToolUse (*.cs) | Auto-formats C# files after edits |
| `post-scaffold-restore.sh` | Claude Code hook — PostToolUse (*.csproj) | `dotnet restore` after project file changes |
| `pre-commit-format.sh` | Git pre-commit (manual install) | `dotnet format --verify-no-changes` ensures consistent formatting |
| `pre-commit-antipattern.sh` | Git pre-commit (manual install) | Detects DateTime.Now, async void, new HttpClient() in staged files |
| `post-test-analyze.sh` | Utility (pipe test output) | Parses test results and outputs actionable summary |
| `pre-build-validate.sh` | Utility (run before builds) | Validates project structure (solution file, Directory.Build.props, test projects) |

## Defaults & Decisions

Every default is documented with an ADR explaining **why**:

| Decision | Default | Why |
|----------|---------|-----|
| Architecture | Advisor-driven | Asks questions first, then recommends VSA, CA, DDD, or Modular Monolith ([ADR-005](knowledge/decisions/005-multi-architecture.md)) |
| Error handling | Result pattern | Exceptions are for exceptional cases ([ADR-002](knowledge/decisions/002-result-over-exceptions.md)) |
| ORM | EF Core | Best developer experience for most scenarios ([ADR-003](knowledge/decisions/003-ef-core-default-orm.md)) |
| Caching | HybridCache | Built-in stampede protection, L1+L2 ([ADR-004](knowledge/decisions/004-hybrid-cache-default.md)) |
| APIs | Minimal APIs | Lighter, composable, architecture-agnostic |
| Testing | Integration-first | `WebApplicationFactory` + `Testcontainers` over in-memory fakes |
| Time | `TimeProvider` | Testable, injectable, no more `DateTime.Now` |
| HTTP clients | `IHttpClientFactory` | No more `new HttpClient()` socket exhaustion |
