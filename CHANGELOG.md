# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **`hooks/pre-commit-antipattern.sh` rewritten** ([#23](https://github.com/codewithmukesh/dotnet-claude-kit/issues/23)) — the naive whole-file grep is replaced by a comment- and string-aware scanner (`hooks/lib/antipattern-scan.awk`) that mirrors the Roslyn detectors' rule IDs (AP001–AP004), severities, and `SourceKind` exemptions:
  - Only the lines a commit **adds** are checked — a legacy `DateTime.Now` no longer blocks unrelated edits to the same file
  - Comments, string, verbatim, and raw-string literals are stripped, tracking state across line boundaries
  - Generated files are skipped; test and migration sources are exempted per rule, matching `SourceClassifier`
  - `.Result` is reported only when the receiver is visibly task-like, so a domain `Result<T>` no longer trips the hook; `new HttpClient(handler)` is no longer reported
  - New: `// cwm:ignore [AP00n]` line suppression and `CWM_ANTIPATTERN_WARN_ONLY=1` report-only mode
  - Fixed a stale header comment that claimed the hook used `dotnet build` diagnostics

### Added
- **ADR-006** — Three-tier anti-pattern detection: why the pre-commit hook scans text, the Roslyn MCP is the authoritative pass, and analyzer packages are the team-wide gate; includes the process for adding a new rule
- `hooks/README.md` now documents the tier model, hook options, and the grep-vs-analyzer rationale

## [0.11.0] — 2026-07-22

Full-kit deep audit release: every skill, agent, rule, template, knowledge doc, hook, and the MCP server audited against current Claude Code docs and the mid-2026 .NET ecosystem, then fixed, modernized, and extended.

### Added
- **5 new MCP tools (15 → 20)** in CWM.RoslynNavigator 0.8.0, all read-only and capped:
  - `get_symbol_source` — bounded source of ONE member (doc comment + attributes included; types return signatures-only unless `includeBodies`; hard char cap with `Truncated` flag). Kills the "read the whole file for one method" token leak
  - `get_file_outline` — type/member skeleton of a file with line numbers, no bodies
  - `get_nuget_packages` — per-project PackageReference inventory, Central Package Management aware, no network calls
  - `get_endpoint_map` — Minimal API + controller route inventory with composed MapGroup prefixes and auth posture per endpoint (`authorized`/`anonymous`/`unmarked`)
  - `get_di_registrations` — DI map with lifetimes, duplicate registrations, and captive-dependency risks (singleton → scoped)
- **`/outdated`** — dependency health workflow: package inventory via `get_nuget_packages`, staleness + CVEs via the dotnet CLI, and a commercial-license trap screen (MediatR 13+, MassTransit 9+, FluentAssertions 8+, AutoMapper 15+)
- **`/arch-check`** — architecture conformance workflow: verifies dependency direction, layer violations, module boundary leaks, and cycles against the declared architecture (VSA, Clean, DDD, Modular Monolith) using project-graph analysis
- **Agent memory** — `memory: project` on code-reviewer, dotnet-architect, security-auditor, performance-analyst, and test-engineer so specialists learn project conventions across sessions
- **Read-only code reviewer** — `disallowedTools: Write, Edit` on code-reviewer; reviews can no longer modify code
- **Worktree-isolated cleanup** — `isolation: worktree` on refactor-cleaner
- **`.NET 11 Preview Watch`** section in `knowledge/dotnet-whats-new.md` (preview 6, GA Nov 10 2026, C# 15 union types/closed hierarchies/collection-expression arguments) with an explicit "don't generate net11.0/C# 15 code unless asked" guard, plus a 10 → 11 placeholder in `knowledge/breaking-changes.md`
- **CI hardening** — windows-latest hook-behavior job (Git Bash, real JSON payloads), shellcheck, docs-count consistency check (31 claims verified against the filesystem), cross-tool parity check, plugin/marketplace/CHANGELOG version-consistency check, cross-reference checks upgraded from warn to fail, YAML-parser-based frontmatter validation

### Fixed
- **`modern-csharp` taught pre-ship C# 14 extension-member syntax** — rewritten to the shipped `extension(Order order)` block form (this skill is the always-loaded baseline, so the error propagated everywhere)
- **Windows hooks were broken** — `post-edit-format.sh` silently no-opped on backslash paths and infinite-looped at drive roots; `pre-bash-guard.sh` over-blocked when jq was absent (the default on Windows) and wrote block reasons to stdout where Claude never saw them. All fixed and covered by the new Windows CI job
- **MCP server** — upgraded ModelContextProtocol 0.2.0-preview.1 → 1.4.1 stable; multi-target TFM misreport fixed (net10.0;net8.0 flavors now report correctly); workspace no longer bricks permanently after a transient reload failure (graceful status + 30s retry); `find_implementations` returned absolute paths; `find_dead_code` name-containment pre-filter upgraded to whole-identifier matching; uniform `maxResults` + `TotalFound` caps across all list-returning tools; `get_diagnostics` capped at 100 errors-first with per-severity totals; Central Package Management introduced; internal code now follows the kit's own rules (primary constructors, sealed, TimeProvider)
- **Skill correctness** — docker HEALTHCHECK no longer relaunches the app; opentelemetry setup no longer triggers the NotSupportedException its own anti-pattern warns about; testing fixtures use real xUnit v3 signatures (ValueTask); security-scan OWASP categories corrected and remapped to OWASP Top 10:2025; project-setup gutted to a tech-stack advisor (was a triple routing collision with dotnet-init/health-check); ddd/resilience/authentication/build-fix/dotnet-init sample-code errors fixed
- **Stale paths** — phantom `rules/dotnet/` references corrected to `.claude/rules/` in CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, `.codex/`, `.cursor/`, and docs; `/dotnet-init` restored to shorthand-guide tables

### Changed
- **FluentAssertions removed kit-wide** — `.Should()` examples in rules and skills replaced with xUnit built-in `Assert` (FA v8+ is commercial); new Assertions stance + Object Mapping (Mapperly over commercial AutoMapper) sections in `knowledge/package-recommendations.md`
- **Knowledge docs verified against NuGet/Microsoft Learn on 2026-07-22** — Wolverine 3.x → 6.x (with migration note), Aspire rewritten (correct `Aspire.Hosting.AppHost` package, v13, polyglot rebrand, aspire CLI), MediatR 14 + Lucky Penny licensing, MassTransit v9 released (v8 EOL end 2026), xunit.v3 3.x, Scrutor 7.x, Refit 13.x, WireMock.Net 2.x, StackExchange.Redis 3.x
- **Rules trimmed to exactly 600 lines** (was 669) by removing tables that duplicated their own DO/DON'T content
- **Three oversized pipeline skills converted to workflow format** (de-sloppify 277→116, health-check 320→112, security-scan 381→121) with deep content moved to `references/`
- **`disable-model-invocation: true`** on `/checkpoint` and `/wrap-up` (session-control commands are explicit-invocation only)
- `.mcp.json` declares explicit `type: "stdio"`; docs/SPEC.md and skill-benchmark-report.md stamped as historical snapshots
- Plugin version bumped to 0.11.0 (47 skills, 16 slash commands, 20 MCP tools)

## [0.10.0] — 2026-06-12

### Added
- **`/spec` — relentless specification workflow** — Turns a vague feature idea into an agreed, persisted spec before any planning or code. Structured questioning in 3–5-question rounds across nine dimensions (problem/users, scope, domain/data, API contract, authorization, edge cases, non-functionals, integrations, acceptance criteria) with a hard never-assume rule: every gap becomes a question, "I don't know" becomes an explicit deferred decision, and contradictions are challenged on the spot. Specs live at `docs/specs/<NNN>-<slug>.md` with a Draft → In Review → Approved lifecycle — approval is an explicit act, requires zero open questions, and implementation never starts from a Draft. Acceptance criteria feed `/plan` (steps), `/tdd` (first failing tests), and commit messages
- **`/plan` consumes specs** — Step 1 now checks `docs/specs/` for an approved spec as the source of truth, and recommends `/spec` before planning any feature too big to describe in one sentence

### Changed
- Plugin version bumped to 0.10.0 (45 skills, 14 slash commands)

## [0.9.0] — 2026-06-12

### Changed
- **Skill catalog consolidated: 60 → 44 skills** — Sixteen redundant skills merged or retired to cut the always-loaded description overhead (~25%) and eliminate routing collisions between overlapping skills. Surviving descriptions absorb the absorbed skills' trigger phrases, so all existing invocation phrases still route correctly:
  - **Workflow/knowledge twins merged** — each workflow now carries its methodology inline: `code-review` ← code-review-workflow + 80-20-review (blast-radius prioritization built in), `verify` ← verification-loop, `scaffold` ← scaffolding (per-architecture templates moved to `skills/scaffold/references/architecture-patterns.md`, loaded on demand), `migrate` ← migration-workflow (now also covers .NET version upgrades and NuGet updates), `build-fix` ← autonomous-loops (loop discipline: bounded iterations, progress detection, fail-safes; test-fix loop is a first-class variant), `wrap-up` ← wrap-up-ritual + session-management (owns the full handoff lifecycle including session start), `checkpoint` ← session-management's mid-session save
  - **Learning skills unified** — `instinct-system` absorbs instinct-status/export/import (now modes: "show instincts", "export instincts", "import instincts"), self-correction-loop (corrections = confirmed instincts at full confidence → MEMORY.md), and learning-log (discoveries → .claude/learning-log.md)
  - **`workflow-mastery` absorbs context-discipline** — token budget management and MCP-first navigation are now its Context Discipline section
  - **Retired** — `model-selection` (the always-loaded `.claude/rules/agents.md` already carries model guidance) and `split-memory` (native Claude Code memory supersedes it)
- **Slash commands: 16 → 13** — `/instinct-status`, `/instinct-export`, `/instinct-import` replaced by instinct-system modes; all other commands unchanged
- **New structural rule: one skill per concern** — CLAUDE.md and CONTRIBUTING.md now prohibit workflow/knowledge twin pairs and document the `references/` progressive-disclosure pattern for deep content
- **Cross-references updated everywhere** — AGENTS.md routing tables, README catalog and counts, docs/shorthand-guide.md, docs/longform-guide.md, .codex/AGENTS.md, all 5 templates, and 4 agent skill maps point at the surviving skills
- Plugin version bumped to 0.9.0

## [0.8.0] — 2026-06-11

### Added
- **YAML frontmatter on all 10 agents** — `name` + trigger-rich `description` per the current Claude Code subagent standard, so Claude can route delegation intelligently (previously agents surfaced with a generic fallback description). `build-error-resolver` and `refactor-cleaner` declare `model: sonnet` via frontmatter
- **`hooks/README.md`** — Documents which scripts are Claude Code hooks (auto-run via `hooks.json`), which are git pre-commit hooks (manual install), and which are workflow utilities
- **Fable 5 guidance** — `model-selection` skill and rules now cover the Fable tier (above Opus) for highest-stakes architecture, debugging escalation, and critical reviews

### Changed
- **Commands migrated to skills (`commands/` removed)** — Claude Code merged slash commands into skills, so all 16 commands now live at `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (60 skills total). 13 moved as-is with `name` frontmatter added; 3 that duplicated existing skill names (`de-sloppify`, `health-check`, `security-scan`) were merged into those skills — this also fixes their double `/name` registration. All 16 slash invocations are unchanged. CI workflow, CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, README, and docs updated accordingly
- **CI now enforces agent frontmatter** — validate.yml checks `name`/`description` on every agent; the obsolete validate-commands job was removed
- **`model-selection` skill modernized** — Opus 4.6 references updated to the current lineup (Fable 5, Opus 4.8, Sonnet 4.6, Haiku 4.5); prose now uses tier aliases (`fable`/`opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku`) so guidance doesn't rot; added "Hardcoding Model Versions" anti-pattern
- **CLAUDE.md / CONTRIBUTING.md** — Orchestrators are authored as skills (Claude Code merged slash commands into skills); agent frontmatter schema and workflow-skill structure documented
- **README and docs** — Hooks tables now correctly distinguish Claude Code hooks from git hooks and utility scripts
- **`.claude/rules/hooks.md`** — Post-test analysis guidance now reflects how `post-test-analyze.sh` is actually invoked (piped, not automatic)
- **`plugin.json`** — Added `displayName`; description no longer claims 7 automatic hooks

### Fixed
- **`migration-workflow` skill recommended a nonexistent `--dry-run` flag** — `dotnet ef database update -- --dry-run` passes the flag to the app host and applies the migration anyway; the skill now previews SQL with `dotnet ef migrations script --idempotent`
- **`ci-cd` skill pinned GitHub Actions `@v4`** — examples updated to `@v5` (checkout, setup-dotnet, upload-artifact), matching the repo's own CI
- **Skill routing collisions** — workflow/knowledge pairs shared trigger phrases ("verify", "wrap up", "code review", "scaffold", "migration"), so Claude couldn't reliably pick the right skill; knowledge-skill descriptions (verification-loop, wrap-up-ritual, code-review-workflow, scaffolding, migration-workflow, 80-20-review, session-management, logging, checkpoint) now state the methodology they own, point action phrases at their workflow, and keep only unique triggers
- **Skill content polish from the full-portfolio audit** — serilog (correct `Elastic.Serilog.Sinks` example, `[LoggerMessage]` pattern, `Serilog.Expressions` package note), ddd (`IDomainEvent : INotification` clarified as the MIT Mediator package), project-structure (illustrative-version caveat on `Directory.Packages.props`), README count drift (skills anchor, hooks claim)
- **MCP server logged to stdout, corrupting the JSON-RPC stream** (#10) — `CWM.RoslynNavigator` now routes all console logging to stderr (`LogToStandardErrorThreshold = Trace`), as required by the MCP stdio transport spec. Previously, log lines interleaved with protocol frames caused Claude Code to drop the connection with "JSON Parse error"
- **MCP server failed with "No .NET SDKs were found" on macOS/Linux** (#9) — When `MSBuildLocator.RegisterDefaults()` cannot resolve the SDK (wrapper-script `dotnet` on PATH, e.g. Homebrew, with `DOTNET_ROOT` unset), the server now falls back to locating the SDK via `dotnet --list-sdks`. Install docs also document setting `DOTNET_ROOT` explicitly
- **`pre-bash-guard.sh` destructive-command guard was inert** — It read the command from the legacy `CLAUDE_TOOL_INPUT` env var only; it now parses the PreToolUse JSON payload from stdin (jq with grep fallback), with the env var kept as fallback

## [0.7.0] — 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Common infrastructure knowledge doc** — `knowledge/common-infrastructure.md` with copy-paste implementations for Result, ValidationFilter, GlobalExceptionHandler (IExceptionHandler), IEndpointGroup + MapEndpoints, PaginationQuery, PagedList, and Program.cs setup checklist
- **MediatR → Mediator migration guide** — `knowledge/mediatr-to-mediator-migration.md` with side-by-side API comparison, key differences (ValueTask, MessageHandlerDelegate), code examples, and step-by-step migration checklist
- **Rate limiting section** in resilience skill — fixed window, sliding window, token bucket algorithms with custom 429 ProblemDetails response and per-endpoint `.RequireRateLimiting()` usage
- **Additional `field` keyword examples** in modern-csharp skill — lazy initialization (`field ??=`) and INotifyPropertyChanged change notification patterns
- **`maxResults` parameter on `find_references`** — Caps results at 100 (default) to prevent token-blowing responses for widely-used symbols

### Changed
- **Messaging skill rewritten Wolverine-first** — All patterns (setup, publishing, consuming, outbox, saga) now show Wolverine code. MassTransit condensed to ~30-line alternative section with commercial license note
- **Modular monolith template** updated to Wolverine types — `IPublishEndpoint` → `IMessageBus`, `IConsumer<T>` → convention-based handler
- **Error-handling skill** — Global Exception Handler section now references `common-infrastructure.md` for the modern `IExceptionHandler` approach
- **MCP server performance optimizations:**
  - `find_references` — Caches `SourceText` per document (200 async calls → ~10 for multi-reference files)
  - `find_dead_code` — Fast name-based pre-filter skips ~80-90% of expensive `FindReferencesAsync` calls
  - `get_dependency_graph` — O(1) file-to-project lookup via pre-built dictionary (was O(P*D) per recursion step)
  - `detect_circular_dependencies` — Extracted `IsUserType()` helper to reduce `ToDisplayString()` allocations
  - `SymbolResolver` — Uses `SymbolEqualityComparer.Default` for dedup instead of string allocation
  - Compilation warming now runs in parallel (`Parallel.ForEachAsync`, max 4 concurrent) for ~2-4x faster startup
  - Consolidated 4 duplicate `MakeRelativePath` methods into shared `SymbolResolver.MakeRelativePath`
- Plugin version bumped to 0.7.0
